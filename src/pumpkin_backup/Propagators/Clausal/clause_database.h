Permanent clauses are never deleted, hence as long as this class is alive the pointer should be valid
	TwoWatchedClause * AddTemporaryClause(std::vector<BooleanLiteral>&, const SolverState&);//creates a clause_ based on the input literals (which are seen as a disjunction), adds it as a learned/temporary clause_ to the database, and returns a pointer to the newly created class. Note that learned/temporary clauses might later be removed by 'ReduceLearnedClauses' and therefore it is essential to keep this in mind when operating with the returned pointer
	
	//The unit clauses need to be added before the search starts. 
	//at the moment, for now I need to be careful when adding these unit clauses during the search. This is done in a special way during search, e.g. backtracking to level 0 and then enqueuing the literal.
